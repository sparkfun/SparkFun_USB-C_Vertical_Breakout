[*SparkFun USB-C Breakout - Vertical (BOB-23055)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/23055)

With this USB-C breakout you will be able to incorporate a vertical USB-C connector into your projects without needing to solder each tiny SMD pad. The vertical orientation of the USB-C connector is also convenient for panel mounts in projects.

The SparkFun USB-C Breakout supplies up to three times the power as our previous USB breakouts *(i.e. Type-A, micro-B, and mini-B)* and also solves the universally frustrating dilemma of plugging a USB cable in correctly because it's reversible! The board breaks out the USB-C connector's `VBUS`, `GND`, `CC1`, `CC2`, `D+`, `D-`, and `SHLD` pins into a 0.1" pitch header while providing up to a nominal 1.5A of power and up to 3A depending on the upstream device.
